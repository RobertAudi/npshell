# TODO

- Search the $PWD folder tree backwards for `.playconfig` local configuration files?
- Queue:
  - Add songs by piping paths into `play add`: `find songs | play add all in-order`.
  - Add a limit to `play list`/`play history` (screen size?) or use `less`?
  - `play clean` - remove non-existent files from the queue.
  - Fix `play add all in-order` so it doesn't add folder paths to the queue.
  - `play add --from-history -1` or similar to add most recent file?
  - `play remove #` to remove sound number # in the queue?
- External player:
  - Set up a music player interface to switch out `afplay`.
  - Don't `kill -9 afplay`, use another signal?
  - Find a signal to pause playback?
- `play daemon`:
  - `play daemon --pause` to try to pause/sleep the audio player, make daemon idle?
  - `play daemon --resume` to resume an idle daemon?
  - Save sound playback position upon pause?
  - Maintain play/pause status between `play daemon` executions, so it will resume playing (or not) upon reboot?
- Index/cache files:
  - If not using an index and an action takes too long, display a warning message "Using indexes could speed up `play add`"?
  - Use `.play.cache~` indexes hierachically when building parent indexes?
  - `play index` to index the current folder.
  - `play index --force` to reindex the current folder.
  - `play index --clean` to remove `.play.cache~`.
  - `play index [--force|--clean] --recursive` to perfom action recursively.
